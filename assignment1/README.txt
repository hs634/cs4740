Steps to execute
1. The python script expects training, validation and test files(in that order) names as command line parameters. It will complain of the file names are missing.
2. Use the appropriate runner method (as listed in the code comments) to run that part of the project. Leave default to run all methods.
3. All the methods have comments for the functionality they provide.
